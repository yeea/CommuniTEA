# CommuniTEA

An Elm learning project with the aim of creating a loaning library that tracks:
* Tea traded around at work (hence the name)
* Books, games, and movies I'm loaning or have loaned out
* Tools
* etc.

UI notes
* Consumeables can be full, high, med, low, empty. Users click top, upper, middle, etc. to update the status of each item so everyone knows what's low or not getting love.
* Star/upvote things people like
* Books, games, etc are a list of items out, and to whom. Or that I have, from whom.
